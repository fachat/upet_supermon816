# Supermon816 for the Micro-PET family

This repo contains an adaption of the supermon816 by BDD from the 6502.org forum as given here http://forum.6502.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=8108#p108407
Note that this is 

1. using the xa65 assembler to build, and
2. it is modified to leave out the S-Record loader as we don't need it here
3. it runs in native mode, while the majority of uses in the Micro-PET is in emulation, so a small shim needs to be included.

The target runtime modes of the assembler are:

- call per SYS, used with the normal PET editor
- call per SRQ key, in a separate screen that is overlayed over the normal screen
- running in the background via serial line

The assembler is loaded into the lower 32k, in a bank that is mapped
into the CPU's bank 0 using the Micro-PET's bank mapping feature.
This means that the bank 0 memory access in the assembler must
be modified to access the memory in a different way.
