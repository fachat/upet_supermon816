# Supermon816 for the Micro-PET family

This repo contains an adaption of the supermon816 by BDD from the 6502.org forum as given here http://forum.6502.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=8108#p108407
Note that this is 

1. using the Kowalski assembler to build, and
2. it is modified to leave out the S-Record loader as we don't need it here
3. it runs in native mode, while the majority of uses in the Micro-PET is in emulation, so a small shim needs to be included.
